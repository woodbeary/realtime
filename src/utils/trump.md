fantastic job Cardinal thank you very much appreciate it so I'd like to thank your remnants very much and members of the clergy so many people I know Speaker of the House Johnson what a job you're

thank my very beautiful wife and thank you for mentioning but can you believe this she did a book and it's a really good book and she worked hard on it and it just became number one on the New York Times list so I think that's so good that's not an easy thing to do especially when your name is Trump and you're on the New York Times list I that thing that must be selling like hotcakes but thank you for mentioning I appreciate good job you did it's a true pleasure to be with you this evening amazing pleasure and these days it's uh really a pleasure anywhere in New York subpoena for my appearance anytime I don't get a subpoena I'm very happy they've got after me Mr Mayor you got peanuts compared to what they you're going to be okay but I have to be careful however to understand that this will be the first time in the history of this event where jokes will be fact checked and they will be and they will be it's been a long tradition for both Democrat and Republican candidates for president of the United States to attend this dinner always it's a rule you got to go to the dinner you got to do it otherwise bad things are going to happen to you from up there we can do what I just saw on that screen but uh my opponent feels like she does not have to be here which is deeply disrespectful to the event and in particular to our great Catholic Community very disrespectful the last Democrat not to attend this important event was Walter mandale and it did not go very well for him he lost 49 states and he w w in Minnesota so I said there's no way I'm missing it actually it was not easy for me to get here tonight I wasn't going to miss this thing you don't matter I didn't care I wasn't going to miss it but that's true Walter male 49 And1 he was expected to do well but it didn't work out it shows you there is a guy that mean those I understand the real reason that she's not here she's hunting with her running l in any event to say weird weird weird weird you know the word weird they called me weird they called JD weird we're very solid people this guy is calling this weird but this was weird that the Democrat candidate is not here with us tonight I want to also congratulate somebody's going to make us all healthy RFK [Applause] J nice to see doing a good job he's a great guy to is he's going to make us a healthier place we're going to let it go wild for a little while that I'm going to have to baby r back he's got some pretty wild ideas but most really good he's a good man he believes he believes the environment the healthy people he wants healthy people he wants healthy food and he's going to do it he's going to have a big chance to do it because we do need that I would not have missed the El Smith dinner for anything in the world I still remember coming here as a very young guy with my father fredd he was a great guy my father he was a he was that tough cookie but he had a thir big heart he was anytime we walk down the street and you don't see Too Much Anymore there'd be people standing with tin cans tin cans and he would always take out $100 and put it in that can and I always thought it was beautiful and frankly I even think more so now it was beautiful cuz nowaday you don't see it so much but I miss him and we used to come here very religiously and uh the great New York tradition has been born 79 years ago it was born 79 years ago and there are some people that were here for almost at like I know many of them and it's not a pretty picture two candidates for president are supposed to exchange good nature bars and you know we get along very well I didn't like Biden very much and now I like him quite a bit and I I say that she's much worse than him he was a much better candidate than her actually and when we hopefully win dispose of her her I like her a lot but right now I can't say i' never like people that I was competing against when you do uh a lot of bad things happen and we are doing well by the way the votes are stared to come in you got to get out and voted Catholic you got to vote for me you better remember I'm here and she's not I could have done that to but you do something that's incredible the Catholic Church helping the poor educating children and supporting the boulder home but if you really wanted vice president Harris to accept your invitation I guess you should have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and riters in Minneapolis and she would have been here [Applause] guaranteed okay would have been okay with that I know this isn't my normal crowd tonight because it just isn't it's not my normal crowd believe me my normal crowd is younger there a lot more energy but you have certain advantages too like cash lots of but many of you have been had liberals from the media in the Democrat Party I always say the Democrat you know Chuck doesn't like that he likes Democratic and it sounds much more beautiful the Democratic party I always say the Democrat Party because it sounds worse he true he likes Democratic why don't they just change the name you know they it is Democrat but uh I must say I was shocked when I heard that Camala was skipping the Al Smith din i' really hope that she would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh she laughs like recognize it any place in this room and all polls are indicating I'm leading big with a Catholic V as I should be as but I don't think Cala has given up yet she hasn't instead of attending tonight she's in Michigan receiving communion from Bret and Whit that's not a pretty sight for Catholics please don't me to insulted by kamala's absence if the Democrats thank you very much I appreciate it if Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening they would have just sent Joe Biden you know he's having second thoughts you know that right Happ he wants to come back if she does any worse than the Falls they're going to bring him back again he's going to do it he's the one that got him out that's the guy much more so than crazy nasty I will tell you cuz I know him he did it Joe has almost disappeared from view the only way he could be seen less is if he had a show on CNN they've got enough than new right than that ter was but you know they say the term is no longer in V because it's much worse than fake I don't want to tell you what the real name is I won't do it there all those cameras would shut off immediately they don't like that but apparently Joe didn't think it was fair for me to have the podium to myself with Kamala skipping the event so he called looked at me and said don't does anybody understand that did that was I thought it was actually very good until just now it was announced this morning that at a funeral yesterday in a rare Moment of clarity Joe to Barack Obama they quote or as Rush L used to say Barack Hussein Obama he was a piece of work we missing but as he told BR the said Obama quot he's not as strong as me she's not as strong do you understand that and Obama agreed saying that's true other than that I think the Democrats are getting along quite well right they get nobody get that one in fact is we need new leadership in this country right now we have someone in the White House who can barely talk barely put together two coherent sentences who seems to have mental faculties of a child say is a person that has nothing going no intelligence whatsoever but enough about Camala Harris I know kamala's work because she spends a lot of time complaining I won't agree to another debate but the truth is I've debated twice this year once against Joe Biden and once against David mure of ABC that was amazing 11 times none for together to say do you think that's fair news I don't think so that's fake news I don't know what's going to happen 3 weeks from now it's going to be uh very interesting it just started it's actually uh so actually isn't it sort of exciting right really isn't it just exciting what's going on it's a process it's a rough presses too not so pretty and yet sometimes very beautiful but the Press is reporting the Democrats are starting to panic they're panicking they are panicking because you know the votes that are coming in are coming in very very strong a certain way I won't tell you what way that is But Chuck Schumer is here looking very dum but look on the bright side chck considering how woke your party has become if Camala loses you still have a chance to become the first woman president I actually you mind if I do that you got to do what you got to do he's a he's a Man actually I hate to say it don't ever use it against I say this dinner was really sent me back I say I've known him a long time there's a group called white dudes or Harris have you seen this white dudes or Harris anybody know some of you here white D doesn't sound like but I'm not worried about them at all because their wives and their wives lovers are all over me every one of those people and as you may have seen Kamala did an interview on Fox News yesterday it went so poorly for her that the Democrats have been forced to install another 100 drop boxes throughout the city and the upside really is Cala now sees the benefit of deportation she wants to deport people she's vicious she wants to deport people she wants to start by deporting Brett Bear Fox an interesting interview last night a major issue of This Racist child care and Cala has put forward a concept of a plan a lot of people don't like it the only piece of advice I would have for her the event that she wins would be not to let her husband Doug anywhere near the nannies keep from that's a nasty one that's nasty I tell these idiots hat do this stuff that's too oh I did I did you know they told me the last time I did this I was running against gin Hillary I mean Hillary I was running against G Hill and I did it and I thought it was a roast so I was told it's a roast and I had the meanest guy you've ever seen right stuff up and the man was the room angry even the gardener few members I went overboard you I was like terrible and I knew I was in trouble around Midway through cuz you know people had even my own side was angry at me they were saying it's too much but uh they did it anyway I campaigning can take a toll on a family and family life although I hear that Gala and her husband carve out some really beautiful alone time at the end of the day for an intimate dinner just dug her and the teleprompter that she uses quite R and by the way she wouldn't have liked this tonight if she was told about no teleprompter I can't believe I saw a teleprompter they said they've never had a teleprompter in the history of this dinner I told that to the C all right and then a telepromter pops up so he must be a very important comedian to get that they give you one but not me how about that one a good job tradition holes that I'm supposed to tell a few self-deprecating jokes this evening so here it goes no I got nothing I guess I just don't see the point of taking chats at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long you know they say about president they say that Andrew Jackson was the president that was the most meanly treated his wife died she died of Heartache she was heartbroken at the way they treated him and they say that second was Abraham Lincoln but he was in charge of Civil War you know but those were the two Andre Jackson up until me now they say it's not even close there's never been a president that's been treated so badly as me and our people aren't happy about it but I was treated it a little bit rough but I don't mind it somehow and I think it's uh just part of the game I'd like to thank our MC this evening Jim African most recently Jim has been playing Tim wallon Saturday night love and that'll be a very short gig I hope but it was fun while last was let's see how that last year it better be quick we don't want him and you know I'm not going to say any W but unfortunately Governor walz isn't here himself but don't worry he'll say that he was I used to think the Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods but then I met Tim W the stupid show the view is so bad now that the other day I was watching it and thinking to myself you know what they really need to bring Rosio Donal back that show is bad those people are bad I know every one of them and they are Bad Dudes I want to tell you and it doesn't do very well I always like to say your know ratings are very important when they don't do well it doesn't do very well as I look around the desk I see all of the usual suspects for instance Mir Adams I like to p on it there but I'm going to be nice I just want to be nice because I know what it's like to be persecuted by the doj for speaking out against open borders we were persecuted I was persecuted and so were you are the May's dietary restrictions are well known but I've got to say I've never met a person who was a vegan who liked turkey so much something about H turkey I just found that out today and I haven't been in New York that much I don't you're going to win we have another former New York city mayor with us frankly easily the worst in and it's not Michael that I could tell you I'm surprised that build ofio was actually able to make it ton that to be honest he was a terrible there I don't give this is ter a horri job not comedy by the way that's fact but unlike the rest of New York at least bill doesn't have to worry about the criminals they owe him big he let them get away with a lot of stuff well I'd better wrap up because be Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Tas they resered many rooms many rooms a lot of room rooms too many rooms but in all seriousness it's an honor to be here to support the city and the community it's a great community that I love I've been here a long time and I love it and it's going to make a big comeback and I'm going to help it make a comeback I'm going to win and I'm going to make it really incredible man a man who was a tremendous politician and actually the fact that he was Catholic was it probably did him and right it probably nobody knows for sure but uh he was a great guy El Smith great guy everyone says it happy warrior I've said before that I'll say it again I'll say it again as many times as I have to directly to the mayor the governor if I have the honor to be elected next month we're going to see what happens it's happening so fast but I have the honor I look forward to working together to make this City greater than ever before we're going to do that we're going to be I work with govern I work with Democrats I will work with them I'll work with whoever I have to and we will even work very hard to bring back the salt tax deduction we're going to bring it back bring it back get that thing going okay I actually thought about not doing jokes tonight I was going to come out here and say listen our country is doing very badly this is not about jokes and then some person said you have to do jokes I said I don't want to there's nothing funny about what's happening to our country and I actually meant that I was going to do that but they convinced me to say some of the things I said tonight I don't know if they were funny or not but uh hey you think this is easy standing up here in front of half a room that hates my guts and the other half loves me half of us love me well maybe it's I think 75% love me but I actually don't I didn't think about that and our country is uh doing very badly with respect to its open borders and inflation crushing things happening in the Middle East and Ukraine it's so sad to see what's happening in Ukraine wow I had a lot of people from very religious people come up to me tonight from Ukraine and they're asking me for help so so sad to see so many people have been killed in Ukraine we're going to get it we're going to get it settled up if we win as I'm President elect I'm going to get that done I'm going to do it before we ever get back we have to get it stopped too much killing it's killing and all of those cities are coming crashing down those beautiful golden does are crashing down on their sides so sad to see the whole thing is so sad so we're going to be for all those people there's so many people came up to the day said religious people from Ukraine and I'm going to say and I told them don't worry we're going to get it stopped it's too bad it ever started should have never started wouldn't have started but uh we're going to have our country respected again we're going to make sure that it's respected we're going to go out and do very good things for ourselves as a country and for the world these are challenging times for our beautiful USA but I'm committed to working with every partner here in New York and all across the nation to build an America that once again is strong and safe and proud and prosperous and free to make sure together we can create a future defined by great Ambitions and Grand achievements that once again inspires the dreams of our children brings back the American dream you don't hear about the American dream anymore we're going to make it possible for them to have the American dream this is a very religious evening to me really is represent so much my my sister was uh somebody that loved the church and gave to the church Cal that had a certain priest that she thought was incredible right for a certain very very fine man that she thought was incredible having uh recently myself survived two assassination attempts they said I I have a chart that went down to the right fortunately I looked at my old time at a piece of paper but it went down and I looked at him right and I said you know was that luck was that luck or was that God that did that and I think it was God that did that I I have a very fresh gner I have a very fresh appreciation for how blessed we are by God's Providence and his Divine Mercy I mean that was something that was not supposed to be here tonight that I can tell you so with God's help I know there is uh nothing that cannot be achieved we can achieve so much good with this country and get together and unify I want to thank the alith foundation for its loal work and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic Community it's a great Community it's a community I've gotten along with all my life I tell you when I was when I was President I was in the loal office said I got a call from the Cardinal and he said we need help it was during the China virus I want to be accurate when I describe and he said we need help our schools are in devastating shape they needed much more than a billion I won't even tell you the number but much more than a billion dollars but I've known the community and I've known the schools I know I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great and they just speak with it like with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen and he said sir we have a big problem we need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York school system the whole system in New York and I said give me 15 minutes I think I can find it and we gave him millions of dollars and you know what he stayed open and they thrived and to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education and every time we see he says thank you very much I said I know what you're talking about but we worked together we were a good partnership right we got that money in about 15 minutes billions and uh was put to very good use but I just want to thank everybody this is a special evening it's a very serious evening I think we have some serious problems in the world but they're going to get solved and we're going to make America great again and thank you very much and God bless you all w
