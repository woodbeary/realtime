# Smart Mirror Project Overview (Oct 9, 2023)

## Project Goals
1. Create an AI-powered smart mirror using OpenAI's Realtime API and Vision API
2. Integrate fashion try-on capabilities using Fashn AI API
3. Develop on macOS initially, then port to Raspberry Pi 5 for standalone operation

## Project Components

### 1. OpenAI Integration (Vision + Realtime API)
- Set up OpenAI API client
- Implement Realtime API session management
- Integrate Vision API for image analysis
- Develop function calling mechanism for appropriate Vision API usage

### 2. Fashn AI Integration
- Set up Fashn AI API client
- Implement 4-6 example function calls for fashion try-ons
- Handle asynchronous responses (up to 20+ seconds)

### 3. User Interface
- Develop web-based UI for displaying live video feed
- Create off-canvas UI components for displaying Fashn AI results
- Implement responsive design for mirror display

### 4. Hardware Integration (Future Phase)
- Set up Raspberry Pi 5 with camera, microphone, and speakers
- Configure two-way mirror with display
- Port software from macOS to Raspberry Pi

### 5. Wake Word Detection (Porcupine)
- Set up Porcupine for wake word detection
- Integrate wake word detection to trigger Realtime API sessions
- Configure custom wake word (e.g., "Hey Mirror")

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: macOS Development
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement OpenAI Realtime API integration
3. Add Vision API functionality
4. Create basic web UI for testing
5. Integrate Fashn AI API with example function calls
6. Implement Porcupine wake word detection

### Phase 2: Raspberry Pi Integration
1. Set up Raspberry Pi 5 with necessary peripherals
2. Port software from macOS to Raspberry Pi
3. Implement camera and audio input/output on Raspberry Pi
4. Test and optimize performance on Raspberry Pi

### Phase 3: Hardware Assembly and Testing
1. Assemble two-way mirror with display and Raspberry Pi
2. Integrate all components into a cohesive unit
3. Conduct thorough testing and debugging
4. Optimize for real-world usage

## Key Considerations
- Privacy and data security
- Performance optimization for real-time interactions
- User experience design for mirror interface
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Cost management for API usage

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment on macOS
2. Create initial OpenAI API integration
3. Implement basic function calling mechanism
4. Begin work on web-based UI for testing
5. Set up Porcupine for wake word detection
6. Integrate wake word detection with Realtime API sessions

This project overview provides a structured approach to developing the smart mirror system, starting with the core functionality on macOS and progressing to the final hardware integration on Raspberry Pi 5.
