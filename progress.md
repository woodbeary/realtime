# Project Progress

## Progress Made
- **ConsolePage Implementation:**
  - Integrated `RealtimeClient` for managing real-time conversations.
  - Added audio recording and playback functionalities using `WavRecorder` and `WavStreamPlayer`.
  - Implemented visualization of audio frequencies for both client and server streams.
  - Set up tools for memory management (`set_memory`) and weather retrieval (`get_weather`).
  - Added image capture and analysis feature using OpenAI Vision API.

## New Decisions
- **Authentication:**
  - Implement one-click OAuth login with TikTok and Instagram as primary options.
  - Include Google, Apple, and Facebook as secondary login options.
  - Utilize Firebase Authentication for managing user sessions.
  
- **Session Management:**
  - Track user sessions using local storage.
  - Store session tokens and user details securely.
  
- **Push-to-Talk Feature:**
  - Introduce a 30-second countdown for the push-to-talk functionality.
  - Disable the talk button upon reaching the time limit and prompt users to reload credits.
  - Calculate usage costs based on a fixed 30-second block.

- **Firestore Integration:**
  - Set up Firestore to store user data, credits, and usage information.
  - Implement CRUD operations for user sessions and credit management.

- **UI Enhancements:**
  - Design a split-screen landing page with prominent TikTok and Instagram login buttons.
  - Add a "More login options" dropdown for additional authentication providers.
  - Optimize the landing page for mobile devices with links to app stores.

## Upcoming Tasks
1. **OAuth Implementation:**
   - Set up Firebase Authentication with TikTok and Instagram providers.
   - Add secondary OAuth providers: Google, Apple, and Facebook.
   - Ensure secure handling of OAuth tokens and user data.

2. **Session Tracking:**
   - Implement local storage mechanisms to save and retrieve session information.
   - Develop functions to manage session tokens and validate user authenticity.

3. **Push-to-Talk Countdown:**
   - Create a countdown timer that starts when the push-to-talk button is held.
   - Disable the button and display a toast or modal notification when the 30-second limit is reached.
   - Calculate and deduct credits based on usage time.

4. **Firestore Setup:**
   - Configure Firestore to store user profiles, credit balances, and usage logs.
   - Develop backend functions to handle creation, updating, and retrieval of user data.

5. **UI Development:**
   - Design and implement the split-screen landing page layout.
   - Add OAuth login buttons for TikTok and Instagram with clear visibility.
   - Implement the "More login options" dropdown with icons and labels for each provider.
   - Ensure responsive design for mobile optimization, including app store links.

6. **Integration and Testing:**
   - Integrate OAuth and Firestore functionalities into `ConsolePage.tsx`.
   - Conduct thorough testing of authentication flows, session management, and push-to-talk features.
   - Handle edge cases, such as insufficient credits or failed authentication attempts.

7. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Review and enhance data security measures to protect user information.
   - Implement error handling and validation for all user inputs and external API interactions.

8. **Deployment Preparations:**
   - Configure Firebase for production environments.
   - Optimize build settings for performance and scalability.
   - Prepare documentation for deployment and maintenance procedures.

## Other Relevant Information
- **Tool Selection:**
  - Ensured the use of efficient and reliable libraries to avoid unnecessary complexity.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Explore the possibility of developing a native mobile app using React Native for better performance and user experience on mobile devices.
  - Plan for scalability to handle increasing user bases and feature expansions.
