# Smart Mirror Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
1. Set up development environment on macOS
2. Implemented initial OpenAI API integration
3. Created basic function calling mechanism
4. Developed web-based UI for testing
   - Dashboard works locally on macOS
   - Microphone integration successful
5. Implemented basic Realtime API session management

## Current Status
- The dashboard is functional on the local macOS environment
- Microphone input is working correctly
- Basic chat functionality is operational

## Next Steps
1. Integrate OpenAI's Vision API
   - Set up Vision API client
   - Implement image analysis functionality
   - Develop function calling mechanism for Vision API usage

2. Implement Porcupine for wake word detection
   - Install Porcupine npm package
   - Set up wake word detection
   - Configure custom wake word (e.g., "Hey Mirror")
   - Replace button trigger with wake word activation for chat sessions

3. Refine UI/UX
   - Improve dashboard layout and design
   - Add visual feedback for wake word detection
   - Implement smooth transitions between states (idle, listening, processing)

4. Integrate Fashn AI API (after Vision API and Porcupine integration)
   - Set up Fashn AI API client
   - Implement example function calls for fashion try-ons
   - Handle asynchronous responses

5. Begin testing on Raspberry Pi 5 (future phase)
   - Set up Raspberry Pi environment
   - Port existing code to Raspberry Pi
   - Test performance and optimize as needed

## Challenges and Considerations
- Ensure seamless integration between Porcupine wake word detection and OpenAI Realtime API sessions
- Optimize performance for real-time interactions, especially with Vision API integration
- Maintain focus on privacy and data security throughout development
- Manage API usage costs effectively

## Long-term Goals
- Complete Raspberry Pi integration
- Assemble hardware components (two-way mirror, display, etc.)
- Conduct thorough testing in real-world conditions
- Optimize for standalone operation
